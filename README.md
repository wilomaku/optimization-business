Linear optimization applied to a business coupon problem

Linear optimization is a method to optimize problems (maximize or minimize a function) given some constraints. This project is an application of general optimization convex problems. Refer to notebooks/simple_opt.ipynb to follow the example with a synthetic dataset.
