# Coupon campaign optimization using Python - PuLP

Linear optimization is a method to optimize problems (maximize or minimize a function) given some constraints. This project is an application of general optimization convex problems. Refer to `notebooks/simple_opt.ipynb` to follow the example with a synthetic dataset: given CLTV (customer life time value), conversion probability (ex: provided by a ML model), and some constraints (such as budget or the maximum number of coupons), the optimizer finds the best coupon per user.
